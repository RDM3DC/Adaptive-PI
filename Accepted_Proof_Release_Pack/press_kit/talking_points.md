# Talking Points (Interviews / Talks)

- The RH as a spectral statement: zeros ↔ eigen/periodic data.
- Adaptive π potential: primes as curvature sources; conformal metric g = e^{2φ}δ.
- Trace identity bridging closed geodesics and zeta zeros.
- Positivity/stability ⇒ critical line.
- Numerical illustrations: closure density pinches at σ=0.5.
- Outlook: L-functions, error terms, and generalizations.
