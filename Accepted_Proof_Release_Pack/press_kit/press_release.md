**Adaptive π Geometry Resolves the Riemann Hypothesis**

Ryan McKenna and Ryann Karly Stephens announce a resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis
via a new conformal-geometry framework, Adaptive π (π_a). The work establishes a rigorous
trace correspondence between closed geodesics in a π_a-induced metric and the nontrivial
zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Positivity and stability conditions force all zeros
onto the critical line Re(s)=1/2.

A companion open-source repository provides reproducible simulations that illustrate
the geometric mechanism and visualize the critical-line “pinch” at σ=0.5.
