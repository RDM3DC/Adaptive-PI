# Adaptive π Geometry Approach to the Riemann Hypothesis

**Authors:** Ryan McKenna, Ryann Karly Stephens

## Goal

Explore whether nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function correspond to geometric resonance states or symmetry lock-ins under πₐ-curvature constraints and whether prime distribution arises naturally as path closure constraints in πₐ-augmented geodesic flows.

---

## Background

- Zeta function zeros lie in the critical strip (0 < Re(s) < 1), conjectured to all lie on Re(s) = 1/2.
- Zeta is linked to the distribution of primes via the Euler product:
  \( \zeta(s) = \prod_{p \text{ prime}} (1 - p^{-s})^{-1} \)
- Many approaches study ζ(s) as a spectrum (e.g., quantum chaos), but few explore curvature-based lock-in from geodesic constraints.

## πₐ Hypothesis

> "Each nontrivial zero of ζ(s) corresponds to a stable wave resonance of πₐ-adaptive geodesics on a multiply-connected curvature field where prime-induced closure is exact only when Re(s) = 1/2."

This suggests Riemann zeros emerge from critical symmetry axes in non-Euclidean geodesic flows encoded by πₐ.

## Tasks

- [x] Build a geodesic flow simulator under πₐ perturbations.
- [x] Model prime-induced geodesic closures with varying Re(s).
- [ ] Determine if closure-lock only happens at Re(s) = 1/2 in curvature field.
- [ ] Relate oscillations to spacing between zeta zeros.

The new `geodesic_flow` integrator in `pi_a.geodesics` performs a simple
discrete integration of trajectories in a curvature field and allows a
"prime forcing" term scaled by the distance of \(\Re(s)\) from the critical
line. This provides a baseline tool for exploring closure behaviour near
\(\Re(s)=1/2\).

## Visuals to Generate

- Prime lattice under πₐ drift.
- Closure loops for different Re(s).
- Standing-wave patterns and harmonic paths.
- Curvature-induced spectral heatmap.

## Bonus

If successful, this project could reveal geometric conditions under which primes align and nontrivial zeros become inevitable, positioning πₐ geometry as a contender for Riemann-style reformulations.
