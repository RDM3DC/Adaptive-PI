1) Wrapped angles (robust far from π)

Use explicit angle reduction before sin/cos so huge |πₐ| behaves:

wrap2pi(x) = ((x % (2π)) + 2π) % (2π)  (centered version: shift to (−π, π])

In our polygon step, use θ = wrap2pi(πₐ) / n before sin(θ), cos(θ).

For extremely large |πₐ| where float64 mod loses precision, fall back to μ-only phase (our two-phase rule) or high-precision reduction.


2) πₐ-radians (units that move with the constant)

Define “adaptive radians” so one full turn is 2πₐ:

Conversion: κ = π / πₐ  (true-rad per adaptive-rad)

Define adaptive circular functions:

sinₐ(θ) = sin(κ θ), cosₐ(θ) = cos(κ θ) (period = 2πₐ in θ)

Derivatives: d/dθ sinₐ(θ) = κ cosₐ(θ), d/dθ cosₐ(θ) = −κ sinₐ(θ) This lets us talk about dynamics in the native unit of the current πₐ while still anchoring to true π via κ. It’s conceptually clean and keeps the calculus consistent.



3) Bounded/linearized gradients in the far regime

To avoid wild kicks when πₐ is huge:

Clip the perimeter gradient term: g = clamp(e·∂P/∂πₐ, −G, G).

Or linearize sin(x)≈x, cos(x)≈1 when |πₐ|/n is tiny/huge in practice (we’re already doing a version of this with the μ-only phase).


4) Keep the loss anchored to true π

Even if we expose sinₐ, cosₐ for internal stepping, the error should still compare against the true circumference 2πr. That’s what makes the flow converge to π, not to some drifting reference.

What this buys us

Theory: a crisp language (“adaptive radians”, sinₐ, cosₐ) to describe the flow with a moving constant.

Practice: stable numerics for extreme starts (±1e6 and beyond) without inventing entirely new
