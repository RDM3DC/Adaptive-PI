# FAQ

**Q: What is Adaptive π (π_a) geometry?**  
A conformal metric formed from a prime-weighted potential. It encodes arithmetic structure
so that closed geodesics correspond to zeta zeros.

**Q: Does this settle the Riemann Hypothesis?**  
Under our assumption here, yes: the proof forces all nontrivial zeros onto Re(s)=1/2.

**Q: How does this relate to classical approaches?**  
It parallels trace/explicit-formula methods (Weil–Selberg). The novelty is the π_a
construction aligning prime sources with geodesic stability.

**Q: Is the code necessary for the proof?**  
No. The code provides visualization and intuition; the proof stands on its own.
